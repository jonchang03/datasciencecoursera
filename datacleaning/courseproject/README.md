# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data #


`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_Analysis.R` is the script containing all the necessary code to do the 5 steps detailed in the course project page.

`run_analysis.R` assumes that the dataset (downloaded from the following [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Title"))
is downloaded and unzipped into a folder /data in the user's current working directory. If not, the first few few lines of the script can be uncommented.

`dataset_picture.png` was a helpful picture that helped me to visualize how to merge all the data files together, which I found from the following [link](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/37290_8e5a126a3a044b95881ae8df530da583.html "Title").

`averages_by_variable.txt` contains the output of the 4th step that is included in my submission.
